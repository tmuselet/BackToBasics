## Contributing

If you are on this page it means you are almost ready to contribute proposing changes, fixing issues or anything else.
So, **thanks for your time** !! :tada::+1:
This repository would gladly receive any contributions. As it is really easy to use, we won't add too many rules for contributing. Please follow the following rules.

### Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

### What are you talking about? Pull Request? Merge? Push

If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub terms you can check a complete [glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) on the GitHub website.

### Support
For any question feel free to fill an issue on the repository

### Bug Reports
The first way to contribute to a project is simply reporting a Bug. If you find anything which is not working well or as expected you can open an Issue in the [repository](https://github.com/tmuselet/BackToBasics/).
Before to open the issue please check if there is one similar already opened on the repository. It will save us hours of work and it will allow us to answer you quickly with the desired hotfix.
When reporting a bug make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are on as well as the necessary steps to reproduce the issue. If possible please include a link to a sample presentation where the bug can be tested.

### Code Contribution

If you are a dev and you want to directly fix a problem or implement a new feature... you are the best one ! :clap::clap:
To propose any change you have to submit us a [PullRequest](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

The workflow we are using the repository is:

1. Fork the repository (as you don't have a direct write access to the main one. For the moment :wink:
2. Create your code, `Commit` and `Push the code` on your forked repo
3. Create a GitHub `Pull Request` to our **master** branch.

We will take the time to review your code, make some comments or asking information if needed. But, as you took time to help us, we will take in serious consideration what you are proposing.

### Pull Requests
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
- Should be made towards the **master**
- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)
